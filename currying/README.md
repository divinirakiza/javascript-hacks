## Currying in JavaScript

Currying is a feature in JavaScript that can be used to convert a function
having multiple arguments into multiple functions having a single argument.

Instead of taking in all the arguments together, the function takes in one argument, which returns a function taking in another argument, which again returns a function that takes in another argument, and so on until all the arguments are fulfilled.
