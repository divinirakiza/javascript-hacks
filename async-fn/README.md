## Javascript Async Functions

Async functions are those functions using which asynchronous, promise-based behavior can
be introduced without explicitly using a Promise.

The ```await``` expression is used along with the async functions. An async function can have zero or more await expressions. ```await``` is used to make the function appear to be synchronous until the promise is fulfilled or rejected.
